# Project 01 – Simulated ICSR Case Processing & Regulatory Assessment

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates end-to-end Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) processing to demonstrate structured pharmacovigilance workflow aligned with international drug safety standards.

A total of 20 simulated and de-identified ICSRs were processed using regulatory assessment principles applicable to both India (PvPI/CDSCO) and global environments (FDA/EMA).

## 🎯 Project Objective

To demonstrate practical competency in:

- Case intake and evaluation
- MedDRA coding hierarchy application (LLT → PT → SOC)
- Seriousness assessment using ICH E2A criteria
- Expectedness evaluation (label-based assumption)
- WHO-UMC causality assessment
- Expedited reporting decision-making
- Regulatory timeline determination (7 / 15 / 90 days)
- Professional case narrative drafting

## 🧪 Workflow Followed

### 1️⃣ Case Review
Each case was evaluated for:
- Patient demographics
- Suspected drug
- Concomitant medications
- Event onset
- Outcome

### 2️⃣ MedDRA Coding
Reported adverse events were mapped to:
- LLT (Lowest Level Term)
- PT (Preferred Term)
- SOC (System Organ Class)

Coding was performed using publicly available terminology for educational purposes.

### 3️⃣ Seriousness Assessment
Applied ICH E2A seriousness criteria:
- Death
- Life-threatening
- Hospitalization
- Disability
- Congenital anomaly
- Medically significant condition

### 4️⃣ Expectedness Evaluation
Events were assessed as expected or unexpected based on assumed product label knowledge.

### 5️⃣ Causality Assessment
WHO-UMC system applied:
- Certain
- Probable
- Possible
- Unlikely

### 6️⃣ Regulatory Reporting Logic
Determined reporting timelines:

- Fatal / Life-threatening → 7 calendar days
- Other serious → 15 calendar days
- Non-serious → 90 days

Applicable to both India and global regulatory frameworks.

### 7️⃣ Case Narrative Drafting
Each case was summarized in structured, regulatory-compliant narrative format suitable for PV documentation.
