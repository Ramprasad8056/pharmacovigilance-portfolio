# About Me

I am a Pharm D graduate with a strong interest in pharmacovigilance and drug safety. 

My academic background in clinical pharmacy, pharmacology, and therapeutics has motivated me to build structured expertise in Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) processing, regulatory compliance, and adverse event evaluation.

Through this portfolio, I am developing practical skills aligned with real-world pharmacovigilance workflows used in pharmaceutical companies and CRO environments.

## Areas of Interest

- ICSR Case Processing
- Post-Marketing Surveillance
- Signal Detection (Foundational Learning)
- Regulatory Reporting (India & Global)
- Drug Safety Documentation

I am committed to maintaining regulatory integrity, accuracy in case evaluation, and ethical pharmacovigilance practices.
