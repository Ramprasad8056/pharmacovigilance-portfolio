# Pharmacovigilance Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Pharmacovigilance (PV) Portfolio.

This repository documents my structured training and hands-on practice in pharmacovigilance, with a focus on Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) processing, regulatory compliance, and drug safety evaluation aligned with global standards.

As a Pharm D graduate, I am developing practical expertise in drug safety workflows used in pharmaceutical companies, CROs, and regulatory environments.
